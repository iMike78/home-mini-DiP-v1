This ESPHome configuration is heavily based on the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition code, with some hardware-specific modifications.  
The code is far from perfect, but it works. Feel free to contribute if you have any ideas for improving it.

The touch configuration may need some fine-tuning, as every piece of hardware behaves slightly differently, even with the same specifications.  
The values you see here are what work with my enclosure and PCB. Unfortunately I haven’t found a way to do automatic calibration under ESP-IDF like we had with the Arduino framework.
